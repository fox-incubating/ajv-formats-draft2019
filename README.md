# ajv-formats-draft2019

The npm package `ajv-formats-draft2019` is no longer maintained and uses unmaintained or deprecated dependencies. And some of these dependencies print a warning message to the console on import. This fork exists to remedy such issues.

I'm not accepting bug reports for now.
